# Tests

Composer comes with a full test suite that tests for the proper functioning of
everything from the utilities/class system to the final objects that rest on top
of it all.

[Jasmine 2.0](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) is used as the
test framework. To load the tests, navigate to `yourserver/test/index.html` in a
browser.

You can also run the tests [on the doc site itself](/composer.js/test) to see
if we stupidly pushed changes to composer without testing.
