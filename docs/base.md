# Base

The base object, which extends [Composer.Event](/composer.js/docs/event), is the
object that all other components are based off of.

## Composer.Base

The base class all others extend. Provides one public function, and a handful of
public attributes.

### options

This is an empty object. Extending objects can use this to store various
internal options.

### cid ()

Returns the object's *client ID*. This is an auto-assigned string value, used to
distinguish various objects from each other *without* having to having to assign
them an ID manually.

__Note__ that you can change the way CIDs are generated by setting your own
generating function in `Composer.cid`:

{% highlight js %}
// assign our own CID generating function (optional!)
Composer.cid = (function() {
    var x = 0;
    return function() {
        x++;
        return 'z'+x;
    }
})();

// grab a cid!
var obj = new Composer.Model();
alert('cid: '+ obj.cid());
{% endhighlight %}
