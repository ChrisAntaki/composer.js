# Composer.js
Composer is an MVC framework for building powerful javascript applications.

As of v1.0, Composer now runs on top of either jQuery or Mootools, allowing you
to build awesome apps no matter what DOM library you choose.

A special thanks to our early users who helped shape Composer in its infancy by
either reporting bugs or helping to write code!

## See it in action
[Musio.com](http://musio.com) is now closed, however you can see a lot of
the functionality of Composer in action by looking through the site. This
site is all HTML5/Mootools/Composer driven, and runs completely in the browser
using pushState (via Composer's built-in Router module).

Composer and its modules were built off of the need to run Musio.com, which is
fairly complicated under the hood and requires a wide range of functionality.
While Composer leaves a lot of decisions up to the developer, it has been 
instrumental in the organization, optimization, and maintainability of our code.

[Turtl.it](https://turtl.it) is another Composer project. It's a client-side
encrypted file/note storage app (ala Evernote).

## Tests

Navigate your browser to the `test/index.html` file in your local repository, or
see the [live tests on the doc site](http://lyonbros.github.io/composer.js/test).
