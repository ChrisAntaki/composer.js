# Composer.js
Composer is a library for building complex single-page applications.

As of v1.0, Composer now runs on top of either jQuery or Mootools, allowing you
to build awesome apps no matter what DOM library you choose.

A special thanks to our early users who helped shape Composer in its infancy by
either reporting bugs or helping to write code!
